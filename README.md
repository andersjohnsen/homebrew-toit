# Homebrew tap for the Toit language

This repository is a Homebrew tap for the [Toit language](https://toitlang.org).

## How do I install these formulae?

The easiest way to install the [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) development
environment for Toit using Homebrew is to do:

``` sh
brew install toitlang/toit/jag
```

Alternatively, you can use `brew tap toitlang/toit` and then `brew install jag`.

----

It is also an option to install via URL, but then you will not get any updates through Homebrew:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toitlang/homebrew-toit/master/Formula/jaguar.rb
```
